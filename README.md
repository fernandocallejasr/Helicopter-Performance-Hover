# Performance en Hover y Vuelo hacia Adelante de un Helic√≥ptero

---  

PPrograms that allow you to obtain the performance parameters of a helicopter, vital for the design of these types of aircraft. It allows you to obtain a graph of the power requirements of a helicopter in Forward Flight and Hover, as well as obtain Data Frames of pandas, all this makes it a great visual tool.

## How to get started

Both programs are built in a modular way based on object-oriented programming (OOP), which makes it very easy for them to expand over time.

To use them you must create objects of the class 'Hover' or 'Forward', these have methods that allow you to calculate and graph the different parameters of a helicopter whose characteristics are instantiated in the form of a dictionary.
